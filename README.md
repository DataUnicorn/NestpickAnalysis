Analysis of the Nestpick Top cities for Gen Z individuals to live in all over the world.

The data is from the Nestpick review of the top cities that inidividuals in Generation Z would want to live in, which was conducted in 2019. https://www.nestpick.com/generation-z-city-index-2019/

I have explored the top 50 countries and how they compare, as well as specific attributes such as affordability and the spread of countries. 

It should be noted that most of the 'top' countries are within Developed nations, and are typically very unaffordable to live in, therefore the practicality and or likelihood of young people actually living in these countries remains to be seen. In addition, the rise of remote working and freelance culture has led to many more options, and the opportunity to stay in much more affordable but perhaps less highly ranked countries. Hence, this list may not actually be relevant towards the actual members of generation Z.

Furthermore, something that the dataset fails to take into account is the amount of job opportunities across various sectors within the respective cities and this is an important feature within most people's decision of where to live.
